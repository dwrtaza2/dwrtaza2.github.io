### CPSC 120

* [Lab 9]
    
    Lab 9, part 2, was my favorite because I was curious about how making a vector of a vector would work when checking the spelling of a word from a file. I was able to write a function to detect a misspelled word and return an empty vector if the file entered was not valid. Overall, I learned a lot from this lab.  

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1, was one of my favorites because we learned about modular programming. Also, we learned how important it is to double-check if an output makes sense. In this case, it was to ensure the area of a rectangle was positive since a negative output is impossible. 

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2, was quite interesting since we had coded the Hilo game from scratch. So revisiting and seeing how far I had come from the start of this class was amazing. Also, integrating a new part of the game, having the game end after guessing the right answer and stopping the game when they failed after three tries, was fun to learn how to do.
